-- Zion Vocational Rehab CRM — the client record, six tabs (consolidation, deploy 1)
--
-- The owner decided (14 Sept 2026) that a client's Billing tab is open,
-- read-only, to Job Search and Intake & Client Reports. What USOR paid is no
-- longer kept from them, so payments join everyone's timeline: the Admin and
-- Billing gate 0081 put on the Payment branch is lifted. Payments were already
-- readable by every active staff member; only the view held them back.
--
-- The screen hints and SOPs that named the old tabs now name the new ones,
-- the Reports role's label reads Intake & Client Reports, and the Insights
-- hints are Admin's alone, like Insights itself.
--
-- Restated in full, as 0034, 0035, 0050 and 0081 did before it: this view is the
-- one definition of what has happened to a client.
